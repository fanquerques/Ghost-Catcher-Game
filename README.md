# Ghost-Catcher-Game

This is a description of a game where a ghost moves randomly within a given game area, and the player's goal is to catch it by clicking on it. 
Each time the player successfully catches the ghost, their score increases, 
and the interval in which the ghost moves (i.e., the moving interval) decreases by a certain number of milliseconds, 
making it more challenging to catch the ghost.

To help balance the difficulty level, the game includes a Reset Speed button, 
which allows the player to reset the moving interval to its initial value if the game becomes too challenging. Additionally, 
the game includes a Reset Score button, which enables the player to reset their score and start again from scratch if they choose to do so.
